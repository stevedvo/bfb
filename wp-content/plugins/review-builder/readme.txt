#### Why should I use Review builder?

If you want to make your business, website or personal pages more trustful and closer to the customers, this review plugin is just what you need! The internet has given everyone an opportunity to express their opinions about every single thing! It's a proven fact that the customers are more likely to make a purchase from a site that has reviews section, they read product reviews before making a final decision.  Reviews are proven sales drivers. They produce uplift in sales and are great to attract customers. Customers trust consumer reviews even more than the description of the product itself. Both, good and even bad reviews help to improve consumer trust, because people read different points of view before making a final decision about the purchase. A few bad reviews will validate the rest of the good reviews and reassure visitors that the feedback is truthful and is left by real customers. Customers relay on reviews which are available online for your business and products. If a page has a reviews section, it means that it's confident and sure about the quality of the product or service it's providing. Customer reviews are knowingly trusted. If customers really like the product and find it useful they would doubtlessly like to leave a review and recommend it to other people. Because it's human nature!

It's a proven fact that customers prefer to read reviews on company websites rather than magazines, newspapers or on social media; so including them on your site is important. Adding reviews section to your site is a super-effective way of getting instant feedback from your readers, on the quality of your site content. Whether it's a blog post, web page, image or whatever piece/element of your website that you want to be rated. Showing average review score helps customers to get an idea of ratings at a glance. It's like a short summary of a long article, made on the product in graphical view. Even the reputation of a company may be depending on the reviews it has on its page. So, it's obvious that reviews are like some kind of indicators of a product or service you're offering.

Add a reviews section to your site and show users you care by providing a one-click feedback functionality. Though social-sharing buttons are a nice way to expand traffic to your site, sharing doesn't provide the best feedback about your content. For example, when a visitor decides to share your page on some website it doesn't mean he likes it or not. Moreover, many people don't like to share too much content on their social feed and as a result you lose their interaction with your content. On the other hand, comments are an awesome tool for feedback, though it requires solid time and some effort from the visitor. Our review builder is the middle-ground in between the two and provides a swift one-click solution for feedback.

**Reviews**

In general, reviews are evaluations of a publication, service, or a company. Nowadays, reviews are a very important piece of software. People want their services, products be evaluated, in other words, they want them to be reviewed. In this way users express their opinion concerning the product or the service they had experienced. "Star" ratings are very common in online services. You buy a product, or use a service and then you can easily express your feelings about the product/service just giving them stars (usually one to five stars). You can even express your thoughts and write a brief evaluating text right under the rating. Reviewing is actually a great thing now, for customers especially. Before making a purchase you can have a look at the product/service reviews and decide on buying it or not. As customer reviews generally form the most fear and true description of a product/service. 

**Design your own Reviews Section**

If you have a website and need to add reviews' section to it, you can do that with the help of this plugin. You can show your users that you care about their opinion adding a reviews' section to your site. You can make up your own reviews' section, all by your own! We all know that design is one of the most important components of anything! Reviews section is not an exception. It should be well-organized and you should take in count every single detail to attract the customer and not to be try too hard to make it vulgar. Select the colors to be eye catching and at the same time fitting each other. Actually it's pretty hard not to cross the line when you see so many options of color settings and themes and all the rest. So, be careful and don't miss any detail. Organize the whole design and set up all the little details of your reviews' section. Set up the stars color, set how many stars you want to be rated, for instance, you can set up max 3 stars instead of usual 5 stars. You can add images of your products and services to be rated. 

**Make it organized**

Reviews of your product or service that you offer should be organized full of valuable keywords directly related to your business. One more important thing to consider, if a page has one or two reviews a day, it's said to be a fresh one. This is because if a product/service is reviewed often it means people use it much and the developer, from his side, keeps updating and making it better every day.

**Control the reviews**

Besides, with Review Builder you have full control over your reviews, showing only the reviews you want visitors to read, making sure your website is optimized for an increase in sales. This is a really great feature, as there are often spammers who leave bad reviews just to make your sales worse. That's why it's important to have control over the reviews left for your products/services, which you can have with this plugin. 
So, if you're confident in your products, go ahead and open your site to ratings from customers! Add a reviews section to your website and give your customers an opportunity to review your products/services, and, why not, they might even leave some notes that you  might have not noticed. Make your sales better and your website more cutomer-friendly!
